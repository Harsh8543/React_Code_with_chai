//  what is HOOKs?
// hooks are special functions, that allows us to use state and other react features in functional components,
// Earlier,when we used to create react app using Functional component,then we didn't have access to the state management and lifecycle methods.

// import { useCallback, useContext, useEffect, useLayoutEffect, useMemo, useReducer, useState } from "react"

// Most commeenly used hooks are:

// useState
// useEffectuseRef
// useMemo
// useCallback
// useContext
// useReducer
// useLayoutEffect
// custom hook
//useState- useState is a react hook,which creates an "state variable". which helps us to track state in components & updates the user interface when state changes.
